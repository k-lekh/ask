# Solve
Solve is alternative name for the Ask framework.
It may make sense because architecture is all around .solve files (which currently are .ask).
Language is Ask, and you write Solves in Ask.
You ask many times to solve.
You ask in parallel.
Solve is a description of data flows.
To Solve, just Ask.
