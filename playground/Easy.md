Look how easy write code even in js, using fundamentals from ask.
Because when we have powerful fundamentals for strings, 

Do I need more fundamental functions for strings?
Well they are just routines in ask:

Imagine you added fast_search method, then you can write routines like this
// You provide imported server functions to the routine executor in the arguments
// Fast search.ask"
```ask
  return fast_search(payload)
```
