ask() or ask('') returns default message, which may contain fundamentals which endpoint may use.

`npm run task` runs infinite dialogue, where output routes to the input as a payload.
since first call is always ask(), the second call, which is first for the user, will receive this message as payload,
so i'm able to use it as text, for example, send to routine or generate code using them.
