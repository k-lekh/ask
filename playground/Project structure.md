# Playground
The place where I can do whatever I want, change any files, write any files, its my work in progress field.
Just folder, commited to the repo, with no rules or linters.

# Cache
cache/routine/${md5} keeps results of the whole routine execution
cache/[ask, read[https://]]/${md5} keeps result of a single fundamental execution, if fundamental needs it.

# Log
Keeps logs data about every ask and routine execution: cost, duration, time, input size, output size
