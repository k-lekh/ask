# Async by default
Every function is `async`, every function calls with `await`.
There is no need to write these words, save tokens.
Any `javascript` is valid in `ask`, and transpilation makes every defined function `async`, every function call makes with `await`.
This is the rule. Every function is async. 
Accept this idea and enjoy full power of async world with reduces headache and mental load.
